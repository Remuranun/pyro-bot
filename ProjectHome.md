This is a simple network bot which plays the Ragnarok Online MMORPG. It interacts with the game at the network packet level. It is designed to run with the latest version of eAthena, although if configured, it can likely run on any server. It has an extensible scripting system which can be used to respond to in-game events, and the interface is a local web service.

Pyrobot is written in python.
